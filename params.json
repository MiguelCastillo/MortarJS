This mini framework pulls together capabilities such as: <br>\r\n* Knocjoutjs integration <br>\r\n* Html fragments <br>\r\n* Css styling of different formats (css and less) <br>\r\n* Direct integration with jQuery UI factory. <br>\r\n* Modular design with requirejs support. <br>\r\n\r\n<p> MortarJs will increase consistency in your code base as well as productivity.  How? <br>\r\n* Everything is provided in a clean namespace as well as jQuery plugins. <br>\r\n* All MortarJs components are designed to provide consistent interfaces. <br>\r\n* MortarJs will synchronize async operations such as loading html fragments and css as well as binding to knockoutjs view models. <br>\r\n* Non intrusive design so that all your already existing knockoutjs extensions and jQuery plugins will continue to operate without disrruption. <br>\r\n\r\n<p> Performance, modularity and responsiveness are core to MortarJs.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact me\r\n===============\r\n\r\nIf you have any issues or want to just drop in a line, you can use my personal email at manchagnu@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n===============\r\n\r\nLicensed under MIT\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

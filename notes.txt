Switch views with routes makes sense when there are multiple views to choose from.  For example, multiple tabs.

Leave resource loading to the view, and leave module/dependency management to requirejs.

Resources in a views are not really modules, they are part of the view.  A module is something that a view uses to complement functionality, a resource is part of the view.

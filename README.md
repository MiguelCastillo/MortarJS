MortarJs
========

<p>Strongly and cohesively bond fundamental building blocks of modern JavaScript Web Applications in a jQuery EcoSystem.  This mini framework pulls together capabilities such as: <br>
* Knocjoutjs integration <br>
* Html fragments <br>
* Css styling of different formats (css and less) <br>
* Direct integration with jQuery UI factory. <br>
* Modular design with requirejs support. <br>

<p> MortarJs will increase consistency in your code base as well as productivity.  How? <br>
* Everything is provided in a clean namespace as well as jQuery plugins. <br>
* All MortarJs components are designed to provide consistent interfaces. <br>
* MortarJs will synchronize async operations such as loading html fragments and css as well as binding to knockoutjs view models. <br>
* Non intrusive design so that all your already existing knockoutjs extensions and jQuery plugins will continue to operate without disrruption. <br>

<p> Performance, modularity and responsiveness are core to MortarJs.
